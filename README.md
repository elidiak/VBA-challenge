 VBA challenge module 2
Code needs to fill the requirements from the challenge:
Create a script that loops through all the stocks for each quarter and outputs the following information:

The ticker symbol

Quarterly change from the opening price at the beginning of a given quarter to the closing price at the end of that quarter.

The percentage change from the opening price at the beginning of a given quarter to the closing price at the end of that quarter.

The total stock volume of the stock. 
Add functionality to your script to return the stock with the "Greatest % increase", "Greatest % decrease", and "Greatest total volume".
